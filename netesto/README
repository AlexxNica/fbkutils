NOTE: There will be a new version of Netesto available on Saturday April 15.
I recommend waiting until then before downloading since the current version
has a bug that is fixed in the new version. In addition, the new version has
better documentation, better examples and extra features.

Netesto is a suite of tools for running multi-host network experiments that
supports the collection and display of relevant data and statistics. It
currently supports  TCP RPC and STREAM transfers through netperf, with other
type of transfers planned for the future as need arises. In addition to running
the netperf transfers, it also runs ping to collect RTT information and it also
collects TCP cwnd and rtt for each of the flows as well as retransmits and cpu
load for each of the hosts.

When running netesto tests, one machine acts as the controller which
communicates with the machines doing the actual sends (clients) and receives
(servers). The controller starts the transfers between clients and servers and
collects the experiment's data. This data is processed and put into a csv file
in the controller, the raw data is also stored in the controller. In order to
achieve this, the files in the netesto-remote directory must be copied first to
the clients/servers and the netesto daemon must be started from the directory
containing these files (./netesto.py -s &).

Another set of files, under the netesto-local directory must also be copied to
the controller, and then a set of tests can be started by specifying a
particular netesto script (./netesto.py < script.experiment).

For example, the following script starts one TCP RR netperf flow using 1MB
requests and 1 byte replies lasting 60 seconds using TCP Cubic.

# Run one Request/Reply experiment
HOST_SUFFIX=dc1.mynetwork.com
SOURCE inlib
SET client=hostname1
SET server=hostname2
RUN MServerRR servers=$server clients=$client expName=1c1s1fr  ca=cubic dur=60
instances=1 reqs=1M reply=1
